  <p>ðŸŒŸ About Me

Hi, Iâ€™m Dinesh Kumar Yadav, a passionate Computer Science and Engineering student with a strong interest in Web Development and Cybersecurity. Currently in my 2nd year of B.Tech, Iâ€™ve started building a solid foundation in Core Java, Data Structures, and Web Technologies.

I enjoy solving problems, exploring new technologies, and working on projects that enhance my skills. My long-term goal is to specialize in Web Development while strengthening my knowledge in Cybersecurity to build secure and scalable applications.

When Iâ€™m not coding, I like exploring new tech trends, learning from the developer community, and contributing to open-source projects.</p>
